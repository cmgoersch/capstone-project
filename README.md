## Hi, this will be my capstone project for the bootcamp of NeueFische

---

I started on 04/05/23 and will finish and present the project on 06/06/23.

---

my project idea:

## better-friend-app

An app which shall help you playfully to contact your and more evenly with your circle of friends!

### Function:

You get a random contact suggested when you open it who is looking forward to a call or a message from you.

### The problem to be solved:

With this app no one will forget about you and your friendships will last longer :)

This app is for contacts that are important to you. People that you really like and that you like to listen to and talk to and who might miss out in a hectic everyday life.

This project was created from the neue fische next template.

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run dev` to start the development server
- `npm run build` to create a production build
- `npm run start` to start the production build
- `npm run test` to run the tests in watch mode (if available)

> ðŸ’¡ This project requires a bundler. You can use `npm run dev` to start the development server. You can then view the project in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The Live Preview Extension for Visual Studio Code will **not** work for this project.
